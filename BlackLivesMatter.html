"We all know that if George Floyd was white, he wouldn't have died."<br>
Say no to a <u><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/police%20state">police state...</a></u><br>
Say no to <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police">police militarization...</a></u><br>
Say no to violent and abborent police oppression and brutality, such as <u><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/guku9d/save_and_share_this_denver_swat_pushes/">this example of SWAT units pushing a photographer into a fire</a></u><br><br>
This isn't just about racism anymore, all the events that have occured have showed how xenophobia, discriminative nationalism, largely-autonomous and largely-corrupt/brutal police are all in abundant presence among America.<br><br>
The fact that there is people taking advantage of peaceful protests in order to loot, the fact that there is actually people and politicans trying to justify the <u>murder</u> of George Floyd, only shows how much of a problem America truly has in its roots.<br><br>
You know what makes this situation even worse? The fact that the racist, xenophobic, and idiotic president of America himself is <u><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate">encouraging and inciting violence against peaceful protesters.</a></u><br><br>
There will <u>always</u> be problems like this as long as psychopaths are hired to "enforce the law." The biggest issue honestly, is how there are people in major positions of power that question and denounce <u>peaceful</u> protests<br><br>
You know what also amazes me? The fact that <u><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/1/21277530/trump-speech-police-violence-dc-tear-gas">officers used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters, just so Trump could have his fucking photo-op in front of a church</a></u><br><br>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gug7i4/young_man_gets_arrested_for_exercising_his_first/">Blatant violation of the First Amendment. Guess this is what happens when you increasingly give police more and more autonomy, huh</a><br><br>

Fun fact: law enforcement agencies such as the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard">National Guard</a></u> tend to be much more peaceful during protests compared to normal police, due to restrictions imposed on the NG by legislation known as the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice">UCMJ</a></u>, which applies to the NG, and the American military, but <u>not</u> police.<br><br>
