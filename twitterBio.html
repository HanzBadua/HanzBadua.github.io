                <h2>The American Shitshow</h2>
                <p>Republicans (GOP as in 'greed over party', also might be fascists):</p>
                <p>- Claim to be the party of freedom, law, order, and democracy</p>
                <p>- ...while suppressing votes and engage in gerrymandering, because they know very well if EVERYONE VOTES, they never win... right? No way though... totally not (/s)...</p>
                <p>- Also might've attempted a f**king coup d'etat, because they lost an election, but who cares right? It's not like dictators and fascists undermine elections like that... right?</p>
                <p>- Support the right to free speech... but only if it's hate speech, because f**k people that want actual healthcare and a living wage (this is socialism btw!!!!), right?</p>
                <p>- Support the right to free expression... but only if you're white, heterosexual, and Christian</p>
                <p>- Undermine reproductive (abortion) and expressive rights in the name of 'muh traditionalism' and 'muh religion'</p>
                <p>- Claims to protect religious rights... uhhh we mean Christian rights...</p>
                <p>- Claims to be the party of small business and a strong economy...</p>
                <p>- ...while giving $1.9 TRILLION in tax breaks to the top 0.1% and big corporations...</p>
                <p>- ...also while opposing workers' unions, because who cares about workers' rights, am I right?...</p>
                <p>- Oh, not to mention the refusal to increase the federal minimum wage for a decade, while increasing their own salaries, right?</p>
                <p>- Plus, it's not like Democratic-controlled counties make more than 70% of the economy, right...? Oh wait...</p>
                <p>To Be Continued</p>
