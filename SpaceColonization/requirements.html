            <p style="font-size: 30px;">Building colonies in space and establishing a permanent, sustained human presence requires many factors. Some of these factors include:</p>
            <div>
                <ul style="font-size: 25px;">
                    <li>Access to sustainable energy</li>
                    <li>Access to materials to sustain development of the colony</li>
                    <li>Life support/protection against radiation and sunlight</li>
                    <li>Sustainable source of food, water, and other essentials</li>
                    <li>Cheap, reliable transportation - to cover the large distances of space, to transport people to the colonies, and to transport resources</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="spacing-cont-fluid" class="container-fluid">
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">Sustainable energy has been regarded has one of the easier factors to solve, as solar energy is abundant in space and constantly emitted by sunlight coming from stars. Because there's no atmosphere in space, sunlight is not diluted by
                    atmosphere, meaning harvesting energy from sunlight will result in much better electrical output compared to utilizing solar energy where there is an atmosphere (ex: Earth). In fact, solar energy in space is heavily utilized right
                    now by the ISS and satelites in orbit. For consistent and massive supplies of energy, NASA engineers have said that massive structures with gigantic arrays of solar panels would have to be built, such as the solar arrays found on the
                    International Space Station.</p>

        <div id="spacing-cont-fluid" class="container-fluid">
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Gathering materials has also been regarded as one of the easier factors to resolve, as colonies can use local resources. For example, if a colony was to be established on the moon, the colony can utilize typical engineering metal oxides found
                on the moon's surface (such as iron, aluminum, titanium, etc). <br><br>Colonies in orbit can utilize materials from near-earth objects, which include astroids and comets orbiting near earth. Materials such as oxygen can even be found on
                the moon, chemically bound to the matter there. Importantly however, unlike the moon, near-earth objects contain volatiles, such as hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.</p>

        <div id="spacing-cont-fluid" class="container-fluid">
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">One of the harder factors to solve when it comes to space colonization, is life support systems, such as long-term sources of air, gravity, protection against radiation/sunlight, inhabitable temperatures, and gravity to help prevent the weightlessness
                of space from physically deteriorating people. <br><br>For sources of air, man-made biospheres (with plants or other photosynthetic/chemosynthetic organisms, to produce air) have usually been the subject to debate about when it comes to
                sustainable sources of air. Nuclear submarines, which allow humans to stay underwater for long periods of time without resurfacing, has also remained an inspiration for a source of air in space, as it has been thought that the basic life
                support technology used for nuclear submarines can also be applied to space. <br><br>The requirement for gravity is important, as it has been shown that astronauts must exercise for extremely long periods of time in order to prevent fitness
                deterioration, because as the human body is not used to gravity-less conditions, whilst adapting to weightless conditions, the human body physically degrades unless force is excercised/exerted constantly from the human body. Rather than
                having long fitness plans/long exercising periods for humans in space, gravity can instead be artifically created by means of a fastly-rotating environment (non-colloquially known as centripetal force).<br><br>For radiation/sunlight protection,
                the Van Allen radiation belts alongside the lack of an atmosphere means the dangers of radiation and pure sunlight are very real. One way harmful radiation and sunlight can be shielded from space colonies is by adding sheer amounts of
                random material around the colony for protection, although this is highly inconvenient as it will add certain logistical issues when it comes to manuevering around the colony. Lastly, harmful radiation can also be avoided by creating strong
                concentrations of magnetism, the way Earth protects us from radiation, via magnetic field.<br><br>Drastically, there have also been ideas of "terraforming" celestial bodies such as the moon and mars. Terraforming is the idea that slowly
                over time, through repeated process, trial, and error, that certain celestial bodies can eventually be transformed into an inhabitable area. Such concepts of terraforming include (but not limited to): introducing large amounts of volatiles
                (such as hydrogen and nitrogen) to a planet to help provide atmosphere, creating manmade biospheres which over time will turn certain, eventually all areas on a planet inhabitable.&nbsp;</p>

        <div id="spacing-cont-fluid" class="container-fluid">
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">The next two factors, which are sustainable essentials such as food and water, and cheap/reliable transportation, will be discussed alongside each other because both factors are very closely intertwined with each other.&nbsp; At first, when
                a colony is starting out, mass amounts of food and water would have to be transported out of orbit first. Before that though, cheaper albeit reliable transportation must be created first, because as of right now, it can cost anywhere from
                $20000 USD to $80000 USD to transport one kilogram worth of material/items from Earth to low orbit. Long-term cheaper methods of transportation that have been proposed include space-capable hypersonic aircraft, or even a concept known
                as a "space elevator," a fixed and stable structure large/tall enough that can transport material and people into low-orbit. The most common designs for a space elevator include a base point on Earth, tethered to a stationary satellite
                in low orbit space.&nbsp; However, after initial mass amounts of food/water have been transported to a colony, it has been thought that food can be grown in space eventually, if the colony has been somewhat developed enough. For water,
                there has been evidence of NASA mapping reserves of ice water just inches below Mars' surface. Estimates from NASA also identify that there may be water, either stored properly or chemically-bound, inside some astroids.<br><br>Overall,
                those are the base factors and requirements that must be taken into consideration for space colonization to become a plausible reality, with factors ranging from more on the easy side such as energy, to huge logistal challenges such as
                life support systems and transportation.</p>
